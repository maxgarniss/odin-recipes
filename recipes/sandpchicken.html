    <h1 class="recipe"> Salt and Pepper Chicken</h1>
    <h2 class="tag-line">Crispy seasoned chicken, fried up with crunchy onions and spicy chillies; this recipe is a real flavour explosion.</h2>
    <p>I love to serve this Salt & Pepper Chicken alongside fried rice and a nice cold beer.
        You can modify the amount of heat in this recipe by using milder or hotter chillies (or even replacing the chillies with chopped bell peppers if you like it mild).</p>

                <h3 class="direction">Prepare the Chicken:</h3>
                <p>In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken pieces with cornstarch, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Toss until the chicken is evenly coated with the seasoning mixture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="direction">Heat the Oil:</h3>
                <p>In a large skillet or wok, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat until hot.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="direction">Fry the Chicken:</h3>
                <p>Carefully add the seasoned chicken pieces to the hot oil in a single layer, ensuring they are not overcrowded in the pan. You may need to fry the chicken in batches.</p>
                <p>Cook the chicken for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Use tongs to flip the chicken pieces halfway through cooking.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="direction">Drain and Serve:</h3>
                <p>Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the skillet and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="direction">Garnish and Serve</h3>
                <p>Transfer the salt and pepper chicken to a serving platter.</p>
                <p>Garnish with thinly sliced green onions and sliced red chili peppers for an extra kick of flavor and color, if desired.</p>
                <p>Serve the salt and pepper chicken hot as a delicious appetizer or main dish, accompanied by steamed rice and your favorite dipping sauce.</p>
